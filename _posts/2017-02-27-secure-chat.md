Recently, communicating privately and securely has caught the attention of the public. Ever since that [Apple vs. FBI encryption dispute](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/03/technology/apple-iphone-fbi-fight-explained.html), more and more people seem curious about how private their information is.

In response, Apple emphasized the security of their products, including iMessage, which is end-to-end encrypted.* But Apple was hardly the only one dumping resources into improving privacy and security.

Facebook introduced end-to-end encrypted "secret chats." WhatsApp now enforces that every message sent and received be fully private and secure. Privacy-centric apps like Telegraph and Signal are emerging from the niche of cybersecurity, and the list of high-ranking politicians using these apps continues to grow.

The main issue with many of these security-focused apps is that they are unusable to the average person. Understanding cryptography is difficult. But in order to fully leverage the security features, it's important to have some surface understanding.
